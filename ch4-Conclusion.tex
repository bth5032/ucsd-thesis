\section{What the hell did I do, and what didn't I do?}

\subsection{What I did}
\begin{itemize}
  \item I executed all the work to get the data from the babies and put them into histograms
  \item I implemented all the signal regions in code
  \item I implemented all the background methods in code, including the MET templates and the FS BG with the RSFOF transfer factor
  \item MET Templates closure test, deriving the error bars there 
  \item I made all the plots and tables we used EXCEPT the temperature plots
  \item I ran everything through combine
  \item I found all the uncertainty ranges by running everything through with varied quantities
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What I didn't do}
\begin{itemize}
  \item I did not make the temperature plots for the interpretations, but did provide the histograms for them
  \item I did not make the covariance matricies
  \item I did not measure any of the uncertainty sources (i.e. I used the Btag working groups scale factors, I didn't measure the lepton trigger efficiencies or ID/ISO efficiencies).
  \item I did basically no writing of the AN or the paper.
  \item \rsfof
  \item The normalization tests for the Z+$\nu$ uncertainties
\end{itemize}
