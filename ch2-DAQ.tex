\section{The LHC}
  The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a particle accelerator and collider which runs underground near Geneva, Switzerland. Figure \ref{fig:lhc_tunnel} shows the outline of the beam pipe under the greater Geneva area at the Swiss-French border. The beam pipe is 26.7 km long and is housed in a tunnel between 45 and 170 meters underground. This thesis is concerned with the proton-proton collisions at the LHC, which constitute the majority of the run-time. 

  The protons in these collisions are sourced from hydrogen gas, which has its electrons stripped at the CERN Meyran facility and are then sent through several smaller accelerators before being injected into the LHC at 450 GeV. The LHC then accelerates the protons such that they achieve a kinetic energy of 6.5 TeV in the lab frame, the collisions between the beams then have a center of mass energy, $\sqrt{s}$, of 13 TeV \cite{LHC_JINST}, \cite{LHC_TDR}. 

  Protons are injected into the LHC in bunches, each containing approximately $10^{12}$ protons \cite{Lumi_unc}, and are accelerated in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions in two separate high vacuum beam pipes. About these beam pipes, superconducting dipole magnets guide the beams around the circular path, and quadrupole and octopole magnets ensure the beams stay focused and collimated.

  The proton bunches extend approximately 55 mm in length and are spaced such that the time between bunch crossings at any particular point in the beam pipe is approximately 25 ns at full energy. The four points, 1, 2, 5, and 8, distinguished in figure \ref{fig:lhc_tunnel}, the beams are crossed and the protons are given a chance to collide. In an average head-on bunch crossing, approximately 20 proton-proton pairs will collide and create deposits of energy in the detectors wrapped around the interaction points. For the analysis presented in this thesis, data was collected during the 2016 LHC run, corresponding to a usable integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$ collected by the CMS detector. Typical instantaneous luminosities during this time period were on the order of $10^{34}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1} = 10^7$ Hz fb$^{-1}$, as can be seen in figure \ref{fig:lumi_stats} \cite{lumi_twiki}.

  \subsection{What gets made?} \label{sec:what_gets_made}
    As mentioned in the previous section, the typical number of collisions leading to measurable energy deposits in the detector is 20 per bunch crossing. Figure \ref{fig:lhc_decay_modes} shows cross section for various proton-proton final states as a function of center of mass energy. Notice that the vast majority of the collisions result in low energy jet production or elastic scattering. 

    The analysis presented in this thesis is concerned with the production of Z bosons, whose production cross section is denoted as $\sigma_\text{Z}$ in the figure. Given the instantaneous luminosity of $10^{34}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, the production cross section corresponds to a rate of 1000 Z bosons produced per second at peak luminosity. Given the total integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$, the entire CMS dataset during this time period contained approximately 300 million Z bosons.

    Notice that the vast majority of collisions create only colored particles in the prompt process. Therefore, the most likely effect of the extra 20 collisions in a bunch crossing is to produce soft hadronic jets. For instance, the chance to produce another Z boson in an event that already has a Z boson is roughly 20 in a million, or 1 in 50,000. However, it is still important that particles from other collisions do not contaminate an event. As will be discussed more thoroughly in section \ref{sec:vertex_selection}, charged particle tracks can be traced back to the beamline and clustered into points of origin called a verticies. The vertex that is assigned the most total energy in an event is called the primary vertex. The chance that two high energy verticies will exist in a single event is low since the number of collisions per crossing is small compared the ratio of the cross section of interesting physics to the total proton-proton cross section.

\section{The CMS Detector}
  
  The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is a general purpose detector at the LHC. The detector is shown in figure \ref{fig:cms_detector}. It is the second largest detector at the LHC, weighing just under 15 kilotons. The envelope of the detector is a cylinder of radius 7.3 meters and length of 21.6 meters. The detector subsystems are embedded like an onion, sorted by what a particle produced at the interaction point would encounter traveling away from the beam pipe, the detector subsystems are as follows:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item{Silicon Pixel Tracker}
    \item{Silicon Strip Tracker}
    \item{Electromegnetic Calorimeter}
    \item{Hadronic Calorimeter}
    \item{Superconducting Solenoid}
    \item{Muon Drift Tubes}
  \end{enumerate}

  The subsystems are broken into at least two regions. The \emph{barrel} region is the central part of the detector, and it is built of mostly of detection modules that are oriented parallel to the beam pipe, since particles traveling through this part of the detector have more transverse than longitudinal momentum. The \emph{end cap} contains modules oriented perpendicular to the beam pipe, since particles traveling through this part of the detector have more longitudinal momentum.

  \begin{figure}[h!]

    \caption{A cutaway drawing of the Compact Muon Solenoid. Taken from the CMS TDR \cite{cms_tdr}.}
    \label{fig:cms_detector}
  \end{figure}

  As was shown in sec \ref{sec:what_gets_made}, most collisions at the LHC produce sprays of hadrons called jets, in fact the bulk of interactions are between gluons. However, more rare electroweak processes, such as the production of the higgs boson, can lead to the creation of leptons. Therefore, measuring the energy spectra of leptons is of central importance for CMS analyses searching for new physics coupled to the electroweak sector; this search is one such analysis. 

  The CMS detector needs to be able to identify charged leptons and distinguish their flavor in order to probe electroweak physics without hadronic backgrounds. The electron is a stable particle, and the muon has a lifetime long enough that it should make it through

  In order to measure the momentum of charged particles, a large magnetic field is applied by a superconducting solenoid that is placed between the hadronic calorimeter and the muon system. The solenoid creates a roughly constant 3.8 Tesla magnetic field parallel to the beam pipe in the region of the detector filled by the tracking system and calorimeters. This magnetic field will bend charged particles in accordance with the Lorentz force law and allow for a measurement of the particles momentum.

  CMS was designed with several physics goals in mind, from finding the Higgs boson, to searches for dark matter and supersymmetry. The technical design report (TDR) \cite{cms_tdr} summarizes the physics and design goals for the detector. A short list follows:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The search for the Higgs boson, specifically in the dimuon and diphoton channel\footnote{the diphoton channel was where it ultimately was found}. This created a need for excellent muon and photon energy resolution and isolation. These requirements justify the advanced muon system and ECAL. Additionally searching for the Higgs in the $b\bar{b}$ and $\tau \bar{\tau}$ channels created the requirement for good offline b-tagging and $\tau$-tagging capabilities, largely regulated by tracker resolution.
    \item The search for supersymmetric (SUSY) particles. The main motivation for these searches is often in the context of R-parity conserving SUSY due to the natural dark matter candidate they provide as described in section \ref{sec:r-parity}. Dark particles leave momentum imbalance in the detector, so there is 
    \item The search for new massive vector bosons, typically dubbed a Z' search. Here dilepton (electron and muon) energy resolution are again of the paramount importance.
    \item The search for extra dimensions. The phenomenology of these models is very broad, but signatures can include all massive standard model particles and gravitons which leave a \MET signature.
    \item Measurements furthering the precision Standard Model parameters. The production of top quarks is enhanced at the LHC compared to any previous colliders due to their large mass, even compared to the TeV scale. Top quarks almost always decay to b-quarks which means the LHC is also a b-factory.
    \item In addition to proton-proton collisions, the LHC also collides lead ions which probe the thermodynamic properties of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong nuclear force. These collisions typically produce hadronic jets and their \pt spectrum is of interest due to observations at RHIC \cite{QCD_collider_physics}.
  \end{enumerate}

  \subsection{Coordinate System}
    Throughout this document, a standard coordinate system is used, this system is a cylindrical coordinate system with the $z$ axis oriented along the beam pipe. $z=0$ is situated at the mid-point of the detector, 10.8 m from either edge. The $\theta = 0$ direction points toward the Jura mountains, with $\theta = 90^\circ$ pointing straight upwards, away from the center of the earth. 

    Rather than $\theta$, we use the pseudorapidity, $\eta = - \ln \left( \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right)$. $\eta = 0$ corresponds to $\theta = 90^\circ$ and $\eta$ grows to infinity as $\theta$ goes to 0. The benefit of using $\eta$ is that differences in $\eta$, $\Delta \eta$, between two particles are approximately invariant under Lorentz boosts along the beam axis, whereas differences in $\theta$ are not. The extent to which $\Delta \eta$ is equal in different reference frames is regulated by the mass of the particles, with equality achieved in the case where the mass to momentum ratio of the particles goes to 0, i.e. the high energy limit.\footnote{Pages 6-8 in reference \cite{psuedorapidity} shows that differences in rapidity are Lorentz invariant and that psuedorapidity and rapidity are equal in the high energy limit} The detector's fiducial area corresponds to about $\abs{\eta} < 2.4$, which is about $10^\circ$ off of the beampipe. The positive $x$ axis is defined as pointing to the center of the circle outlined by the LHC, and the positive $y$ axis points towards the sky. The $\phi$ direction is the angle from the positive $x$ axis to the positive $y$ axis. Figure \ref{fig:cms_coordinates} shows this information visually.

  \subsection{The Inner Tracker} \label{sec:inner_tracker}
    The inner tracker is the closest part of the CMS detector to LHC beamline and interaction point where protons collide. \cite{cms_jinst} It surrounds the interaction point with a length of 5.8m and radius of 1.25m. The purpose of the system is to track charged particles to their vertex and measure the momentum of charged particles via the saggita in the particle arc due to the magnetic field. The entire active detection area of the inner-tracker system is made of silicon, but can be broken into 2 main subsystems:

    \begin{enumerate}
      \bitem{pixel detectors} The innermost part of the tracker system is a pixel-based detector composed of 1,440 thin modules, of cross section $100 \times 150 \mu$m$^2$, capable of measuring hits with fine granularity in 3 dimensions. This subsystem's main purpose is to aid in vertex reconstruction.
      \bitem{strip detectors} The outer part of the inner tracker is composed of 15,148 strip modules. The main purpose of this subsystem is to track charged particles from the vertex into the ECAL and also to give one measure of their momentum.
    \end{enumerate}

    Silicon detectors work on the principle of semi-conduction. When a charged particle passes through the material, electrons are kicked into the conduction band and drift, due to a bias voltage applied across the sample, towards electronics attached to the material that record the current. Because silicon has a relatively small band gap, the entire tracking system needs to be kept at low temperature, approximately $-10^\circ$ C, in order to keep the electrons stationary in the valence band in the presence of the bias voltage.

    The tracker geometry is shown in figure \ref{fig:strip_tracker_geometry}. The pixel detectors are the closest to the beampipe and consist of 3 layers in the barrel region and 2 annuli in the endcap region. The three barrel layers are positioned in concentric cylinders about the beampipe at radii of 4.4 cm, 7.3 cm, and 10.2 cm respectively. The endcap annuli are placed at $\abs{z} = 34.5 $cm and 46.5 cm respectively and have an inner radius of 6 cm and an outer radius of 15 cm. The strip tracker consists of an inner barrel region (TIB), an outer barrel region (TOB), and an inner disk region (TID) in the barrel, and two endcap regions (TEC +/-).

      \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{figures/cms_tracker_schematic.pdf}
      \caption{Schematic view of the CMS inner tracking system. Notice the detectors only cover $\abs{\eta}$ ranges less than 2.5 and that particles traveling near $\abs{\eta}=1.5$ pass through the most material. Taken from \cite{cms_jinst}.}
      \label{fig:strip_tracker_geometry}
    \end{figure}

    Because one of the goals of the tracking system is to obtain a measure of momentum by tracking the natural motion of particles through space in a magnetic field, it is important that the interactions between charged particles and the tracking system do not change the motion of the particles dramatically. It is typical to look at the number of radiation lengths\footnote{taken to be the distance at which a high energy electron is expected to lose $\frac{1}{e}$ of its energy \cite[sec 34.4.2]{PDG}, $\frac{7}{9}$ the mean free path for a high energy photon.} "material budget" of the tracker as a measure of the expected
