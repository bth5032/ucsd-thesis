  abstract={The performance of muon reconstruction, identification, and triggering in CMS has been studied using 40 pb â1 of data collected in pp collisions at â s = 7 TeV at the LHC in 2010. A few benchmark sets of selection criteria covering a wide range of physics analysis needs have been examined. For all considered selections, the efficiency to reconstruct and identify a muon with a transverse momentum p T larger than a few GeV/c is above 95% over the whole region of pseudorapidity covered by the CMS muon system, |Î·| < 2.4, while the probability to misidentify a hadron as a muon is well below 1%. The efficiency to trigger on single muons with p T above a few GeVc is higher than 90% over the full Î· range, and typically substantially better. The overall momentum scale is measured to a precision of 0.2% with muons from Z decays. The transverse momentum resolution varies from 1% to 6% depending on pseudorapidity for muons with p T below 100GeV/c and, using cosmic rays, it is shown to be better than 10% in the central region up to p T = 1 TeV/c. Observed distributions of all quantities are well reproduced by the Monte Carlo simulation.}

  abstract={The CMS silicon tracker consists of two tracking devices utilizing semiconductor technology: the inner pixel and the outer strip detectors. They operate in a high-occupancy and high-radiation environment presented by particle collisions in the LHC. The tracker detectors occupy the region around the center of CMS, where the LHC beams collide, between 4 cm and 110 cm in radius and up to 280 cm along the beam axis. The pixel detector consists of 66 million pixels, covering about 1 m 2 total area. It is surrounded by the strip tracker with 10 million read-out channels covering about 200 m 2 total area. The proceedings describe the operational experience collected during the first three years of LHC running. Results include operational challenges encountered during data taking that influence the active fraction and read-out efficiency of the detectors. Details are given about the performance of the tracker at high occupancy with respect to local observables such as signal to noise ratio and hit reconstruction efficiency. Studies of radiation effects are presented with respect to the evolution of sensor bias, read-out thresholds in the inner pixels, and leakage current.}

  abstract={The CMS apparatus was identified, a few years before the start of the LHC operation at CERN, to feature properties well suited to particle-flow (PF) reconstruction: a highly-segmented tracker, a fine-grained electromagnetic calorimeter, a hermetic hadron calorimeter, a strong magnetic field, and an excellent muon spectrometer. A fully-fledged PF reconstruction algorithm tuned to the CMS detector was therefore developed and has been consistently used in physics analyses for the first time at a hadron collider. For each collision, the comprehensive list of final-state particles identified and reconstructed by the algorithm provides a global event description that leads to unprecedented CMS performance for jet and hadronic Ï decay reconstruction, missing transverse momentum determination, and electron and muon identification. This approach also allows particles from pileup interactions to be identified and enables efficient pileup mitigation methods. The data collected by CMS at a centre-of-mass energy of 8\TeV show excellent agreement with the simulation and confirm the superior PF performance at least up to an average of 20 pileup interactions.}

  abstract={This paper describes the CMS trigger system and its performance during Run 1 of the LHC. The trigger system consists of two levels designed to select events of potential physics interest from a GHz (MHz) interaction rate of proton-proton (heavy ion) collisions. The first level of the trigger is implemented in hardware, and selects events containing detector signals consistent with an electron, photon, muon, Ï lepton, jet, or missing transverse energy. A programmable menu of up to 128 object-based algorithms is used to select events for subsequent processing. The trigger thresholds are adjusted to the LHC instantaneous luminosity during data taking in order to restrict the output rate to 100 kHz, the upper limit imposed by the CMS readout electronics. The second level, implemented in software, further refines the purity of the output stream, selecting an average rate of 400 Hz for offline event storage. The objectives, strategy and performance of the trigger system during the LHC Run 1 are described.}

  abstract={A large sample of cosmic ray events collected by the CMS detector is exploited to measure the specific energy loss of muons in the lead tungstate (PbWO 4 ) of the electromagnetic calorimeter. The measurement spans a momentum range from 5 GeV/ c to 1 TeV/ c . The results are consistent with the expectations over the entire range. The calorimeter energy scale, set with 120 GeV/ c electrons, is validated down to the sub-GeV region using energy deposits, of order 100 MeV, associated with low-momentum muons. The muon critical energy in PbWO 4 is measured to be 160 +5 â6 Â±8 GeV, in agreement with expectations. This is the first experimental determination of muon critical energy.}

Despite the very hostile environment at the LHC, the performance obtained with these algorithms is found to be excellent. For t ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/bart.gif] {bar t} events under typical 2011 pileup conditions, the average track-reconstruction efficiency for promptly-produced charged particles with transverse momenta of p TÂ >Â 0.9GeV is 94% for pseudorapidities of |Î·|Â <Â 0.9 and 85% for 0.9Â <Â |Î·|Â <Â 2.5. The inefficiency is caused mainly by hadrons that undergo nuclear interactions in the tracker material. For isolated muons, the corresponding efficiencies are essentially 100%. For isolated muons of p T Â =Â 100GeV emitted at |Î·|Â <Â 1.4, the resolutions are approximately 2.8% in p T , and respectively, 10ÎŒm and 30ÎŒm in the transverse and longitudinal impact parameters. The position resolution achieved for reconstructed primary vertices that correspond to interesting pp collisions is 10â12ÎŒm in each of the three spatial dimensions. The tracking and vertexing software is fast and flexible, and easily adaptable to other functions, such as fast tracking for the trigger, or dedicated tracking for electrons that takes into account bremsstrahlung.}

  abstract={The bremsstrahlung energy loss distribution of electrons propagating in matter is highly non-Gaussian. Because the Kalman filter relies solely on Gaussian probability density functions, it is not necessarily the optimal reconstruction algorithm for electron tracks. A Gaussian-sum filter (GSF) algorithm for electron reconstruction in the CMS tracker has therefore been developed and implemented. The basic idea is to model the bremsstrahlung energy loss distribution by a Gaussian mixture rather than by a single Gaussian. It is shown that the GSF is able to improve the momentum resolution of electrons compared to the standard Kalman filter. The momentum resolution and the quality of the error estimate are studied both with a fast simulation, modelling the radiative energy loss in a simplified detector, and the full CMS tracker simulation.}

  abstract={The calibration and reconstruction of jets critically relies on the performance of the calorimeters. Extending out to large pseudorapidities, the measurements depend on the interplay between forward calorimeters, central calorimeters, and the tracking system. The high number of additional pile-up interactions poses further complications. In CMS, these difficulties are overcome using the 'particle-flow' approach, which aims at reconstructing individually each particle in the event prior to the jet clustering. Measurements of the jet energy scale and the procedure for jet energy calibration in CMS are reviewed, which are performed with dijet, photon + jet, and Z+jet data collected in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.6 fb â1 . The effect of pile-up interactions and the state of the art mitigation techniques used in CMS as well as the main sources of uncertainty of the jet energy calibration are also presented.}

We examine some properties of a new member of this class, for which the power is negative. This ``anti- k t '' algorithm essentially behaves like an idealised cone algorithm, in that jets with only soft fragmentation are conical, active and passive areas are equal, the area anomalous dimensions are zero, the non-global logarithms are those of a rigid boundary and the Milan factor is universal. None of these properties hold for existing sequential recombination algorithms, nor for cone algorithms with split-merge steps, such as SISCone. They are however the identifying characteristics of the collinear unsafe plain ``iterative cone'' algorithm, for which the anti- k t algorithm provides a natural, fast, infrared and collinear safe replacement.}

  abstract={At the Large Hadron Collider, the identification of jets originating from b quarks is important for searches for new physics and for measurements of standard model processes. A variety of algorithms has been developed by CMS to select b-quark jets based on variables such as the impact parameters of charged-particle tracks, the properties of reconstructed decay vertices, and the presence or absence of a lepton, or combinations thereof. The performance of these algorithms has been measured using data from proton-proton collisions at the LHC and compared with expectations based on simulation. The data used in this study were recorded in 2011 at â s = 7 TeV for a total integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb -1 . The efficiency for tagging b-quark jets has been measured in events from multijet and t-quark pair production. CMS has achieved a b-jet tagging efficiency of 85% for a light-parton misidentification probability of 10% in multijet events. For analyses requiring higher purity, a misidentification probability of only 1.5% has been achieved, for a 70% b-jet tagging efficiency.}

In this paper, the discriminating variables and the algorithms used for heavy-flavour jet identification during the first years of operation of the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, are presented. Heavy-flavour jet identification algorithms have been improved compared to those used previously at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. For jets with transverse momenta in the range expected in simulated ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/bart.gif] {bar t} events, these new developments result in an efficiency of 68% for the correct identification of a b jet for a probability of 1% of misidentifying a light-flavour jet. The improvement in relative efficiency at this misidentification probability is about 15%, compared to previous CMS algorithms. In addition, for the first time algorithms have been developed to identify jets containing two b hadrons in Lorentz-boosted event topologies, as well as to tag c jets. The large data sample recorded in 2016 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV has also allowed the development of new methods to measure the efficiency and misidentification probability of heavy-flavour jet identification algorithms. The b jet identification efficiency is measured with a precision of a few per cent at moderate jet transverse momenta (between 30 and 300 GeV) and about 5% at the highest jet transverse momenta (between 500 and 1000 GeV).}

We focus on the properties of the test procedures that allow one to account for systematic uncertainties. Explicit formulae for the asymptotic distributions of test statistics are derived using results of Wilks and Wald. We motivate and justify the use of a representative data set, called the ``Asimov data set'', which provides a simple method to obtain the median experimental sensitivity of a search or measurement as well as fluctuations about this expectation.",

  abstract={I describe a framework for the presentation of search results which is motivated by frequentist statistics. The most well-known use of this framework is for the combined search for the Higgs boson at LEP. A toy neutrino oscillations experiment is used to illustrate the rich information available in the framework for exclusion and discovery. I argue that the so-called CL s technique for setting limits is appropriate for determining exclusion intervals while the determination of confidence intervals advocated by Feldman and Cousins' method is more appropriate for treating established signals, i.e. going beyond discovery to measurement.

We discuss basic technical principles of the CMS Fast Simulation and their implementation in the different components of the detector: the silicon tracker, the electromagnetic calorimeter, the hadronic calorimeter, the muon system, the Level 1 and the High Level Trigger. A few comparisons of the Fast Simulation results both with the GEANT4-based Full Simulation and with the LHC data are shown.}

This variable is closely related to the transverse mass variable commonly used for measuring the W mass at hadron colliders, and like the transverse mass our variable extracts masses in a reasonably model independent way. Without considering either backgrounds or measurement errors we consider how our variable would perform measuring the mass of selectrons in a mSUGRA SUSY model at the LHC."

  abstract={The performance and strategies used in electron reconstruction and selection at CMS are presented based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb â1 , collected in proton-proton collisions at â sÂ =Â 8Â TeV at the CERN LHC. The paper focuses on prompt isolated electrons with transverse momenta ranging from about 5 to a few 100 GeV. A detailed description is given of the algorithms used to cluster energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter and to reconstruct electron trajectories in the tracker. The electron momentum is estimated by combining the energy measurement in the calorimeter with the momentum measurement in the tracker. Benchmark selection criteria are presented, and their performances assessed using Z, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/Upsilon.gif] {Upsilon} , and J/Ï decays into e + + e â pairs. The spectra of the observables relevant to electron reconstruction and selection as well as their global efficiencies are well reproduced by Monte Carlo simulations. The momentum scale is calibrated with an uncertainty smaller than 0.3%. The momentum resolution for electrons produced in Z boson decays ranges from 1.7 to 4.5%, depending on electron pseudorapidity and energy loss through bremsstrahlung in the detector material.}
