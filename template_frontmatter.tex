%% DEDICATION
%
%  You have three choices here:
%    1. Use the ``dedication'' environment.
%       Put in the text you want, and everything will be formated for
%       you. You'll get a perfectly respectable dedication page.
%
%
%    2. Use the ``mydedication'' environment.  If you don't like the
%       formatting of option 1, use this environment and format things
%       however you wish.
%
%    3. If you don't want a dedication, it's not required.

  To my Mother and Father, who taught me to reach and keep reaching.

\begin{abstract}
  This thesis presents the results of a search for new physics in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, running at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV using data gathered by the Compact Muon Solenoid. The search uses a final state with two opposite-charge same-flavor light leptons (electrons or muons), at least 2 hadronic jets, and at least 100 GeV of missing transverse momentum. No statitsically significant deviation is found from the expected standard model background. The search results are interpreted in the context of several simplied model spectra (SMS) of supersymmetry, including a model of Gauge Mediated Supersymmetry-Breaking (GSMB) with gluino production and models with Electroweakino production. The limits on these models are advanced by several 100 GeV in mass parameters with respect to previous searches, and this work represents the current state of the art for their exclusion.
